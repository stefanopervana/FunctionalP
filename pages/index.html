<li class="littag"> Functional programming techniques and their impact on overall design</li>
<li class="littag"> Extensibility—Do I constantly refactor my code to support additional functionality?</li>
<li class="littag"> Easy to modularize—If I change one file, is another file affected?</li>
<li class="littag"> Reusability—Is there a lot of duplication?</li>
<li class="littag"> Testability—Do I struggle to unit test my functions?</li>
<li class="litag> Easy to reason about—Is my code unstructured and hard to follow?</li>
<li class="littag"> Declarative programming</li>
<li class="littag"> Pure functions</li>
<li class="littag"> Referential transparency</li>
<li class="littag"> Immutability</li>
<li class="littag"> It depends only on the input provided and not on any hidden or external state that may change during its evaluation or between calls.</li>
<li class="littag"> It doesn’t inflict changes beyond their scope, such as modifying a global object or a parameter passed by reference.</li>
<li class="littag"> Changing a variable, property, or data structure globally</li>
<li class="littag"> Changing the original value of a function’s argument</li>
<li class="littag"> Processing user input</li>
<li class="littag"> Throwing an exception, unless it’s caught within the same function</li>
<li class="littag"> Printing to the screen or logging</li>
<li class="littag"> Querying the HTML documents, browser cookies, or databases</li>
<li class="littag"> It interacts with an external variable (db) for data access because the function signature doesn’t declare this parameter. At any point in time, this reference could become null or change from one call to the next, yielding completely different results and compromising the integrity of the program.</li>
<li class="littag"> The global variable elementld can change at any time, outside your control.</li>
<li class="littag"> HTML elements are directly modified. The HTML document (DOM) is itself a mutable, shared, global resource.</li>
<li class="littag"> It can potentially throw an exception if the student isn’t found, which causes the entire program stack to unwind and end abruptly.</li>
<li class="littag"> Separate this long function into shorter functions, each with a single purpose.</li>
<li class="littag"> Reduce the number of side effects by explicitly defining all arguments needed for the functions to carry out their job.</li>
<li class="littag"> It’s a lot more flexible, because it now has three reusable components.</li>
<li class="littag"> This fine-grained function reuse is a strategy for increasing your productivity, because you can dramatically reduce the footprint of code that must be actively managed.</li>
<li class="littag"> You enhance the code’s readability by following a declarative style that provides a clear view of the high-level steps carried out by this program.</li>
<li class="littag"> More important, interaction with the HTML objects is moved into its own func- tion, isolating the pure from the non-pure (impure) behavior. I explain curry- ing and managing pure and impure parts in depth in chapter 4.</li>
<li class="littag"> Encourage you to decompose tasks into simple functions</li>
<li class="littag"> Process data using fluent chains</li>
<li class="littag"> Decrease the complexity of event-driven code by enabling reactive paradigms</li>
<li class="littag"> Selecting the proper set of students (whose enrollment is greater than one)</li>
<li class="littag"> Extracting their grades</li>
<li class="littag"> Calculating their average grade</li>
<li class="littag"> Code that uses pure functions has zero chance of changing or breaking global state, which helps make your code more testable and maintainable.</li>
<li class="litag" data-jsx="2337320473" data-reactid="360"> Functional programming is done in a declarative style that’s easy to reason about. This improves the overall readability of the application and makes your code leaner through a combination of functions and lambda expressions.</li>
<li class="littag"> Data processing in a collection of elements is done fluently via function chains that link operations such as map and reduce.</li>
<li class="littag"> Functional programming treats functions as building blocks by relying on first-class, higher-order functions to improve the modularity and reusability of your code.</li>
<li class="littag"> You can reduce the complexity of event-based programs by combining func- tional with reactive programming.</li>
